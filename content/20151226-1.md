型塑二十一世紀大學

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

二十一世紀, 在網路科技的推波助瀾下, 許多行業與組織都產生了本質上的變化, 大學, 這個經常被稱為象牙塔的最後防線, 也終於必須因應全球化知識經濟的快速發展, 而做出相當程度的進化, 否則難逃被淘汰的命運.

從許多文獻的觀察可以得知, 二十一世紀的大學, 必須讓團隊中特定比例的成員, 擁抱知識創業的趨勢.

在此, 我們認為, 至少 70% 的大學成員必須俱備知識創業的能力與作為, 其餘的成員則仍能一如既往, 按照本身的認知, 從事任何自己有興趣的教學與研究, 而無需受到是否真正達到所謂知識的精進或創業獲利的約束.

Intellectual Entrepreneurship (知識創業)

Intellectual Entrepreneurship is a philosophy and vision of education viewing academics as "innovators" and "agents of change." It focuses on creating cross-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaborations designed to produce intellectual advancements (知識進展) with a capacity to provide real solutions (真正的解決方案) to society's problems and needs. Intellectual Entrepreneurship is academic engagement for the purpose of changing lives.

Intellectual Entrepreneurship moves the mission of institutions of higher learning from "advancing the frontiers of knowledge" (推進知識前緣) and "preparing tomorrow's leaders" (培育未來領導人) to also "serving as engines of economic and social development." (成為經濟與社會發展的引擎) In the process, the role of faculty member and student evolves from that of "intellectual provocateur" (知識激發者)to becoming what might be called an "intellectual entrepreneur." (知識創業者) Intellectual Entrepreneurship includes a readiness to seek out opportunities, undertake the responsibility associated with each and tolerate the uncertainty that comes with initiating genuine innovation. Intellectual Entrepreneurship changes the model and metaphor of higher education from one of "apprenticeship-certification-entitlement" (學徒-認証-授權) to one of "discovery-ownership-accountability." (發現-擁有-負責)

Intellectual Entrepreneurship is premised on the belief that intellect is not limited to the academy and entrepreneurship is not restricted to or synonymous with business. Entrepreneurship is a process of cultural innovation. (創業是一種文化創新的過程) While the creation of material wealth is one expression of entrepreneurship, at a more profound level entrepreneurship is an attitude for engaging the world. Intellectual entrepreneurs, both inside and outside universities, take risks and seize opportunities (承擔風險並緊握機會), discover and create knowledge (發現並創造知識), innovate (創新) , collaborate (協同) and solve problems in any number of social realms (解決社會範疇上的問題): corporate, non-profit, government, and education (企業, 非營利, 政府與教育單位).

Intellectual entrepreneurs understand that genuine collaboration between universities and the public is tantamount to more than increased "access" to the academy's intellectual assets. It is more than "knowledge transfer"--the exportation of neatly wrapped solutions rolling off the campus conveyer belt. Collaboration demands mutual humility and respect, joint ownership of learning and co-creation of an unimagined potential for innovation--qualities that move universities well beyond the typical elitist sense of "service." Knowledge, after all, involves the integration of theory, practice and production (知識終究包括理論, 實踐與生產的整合).
